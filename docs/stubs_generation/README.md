## Python stubs generation

This folder contains a slightly modified version of [intellij-community](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/python/helpers/generator3)'s stub generator for python binary modules, to parse RST documentation and generate typed helpers.

It has had some modifications to work better within RenderDoc's desired environment rather than an IDE, as well as producing more desirable output.

It remains licensed under the Apache license to the original contributors.
